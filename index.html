<p> Hey everyone, my name is Andy Kim. I'm 25 years old and I'm a senior at UCF, studying psychology. My current goal at the time is to go to graduate school
    to get into either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT for short), or possibly pursue a MD specializing in neuro-imaging. I'm a pretty typical nerdy guy
    who loves video games, music and movies. I just recently came back from a music festival called Shaky Knees in Atlanta, Georgia so you'll probably hear me 
    suggest bands that I heard from over there. 
</p>

<p>
    My current hobbies are playing Overwatch with my girlfriend, teaching myself how to play guitar (I'm still really, <strong>REALLY </strong>bad), and picking up
    new board games from time to time with my friends. I am trying to get a hold of a copy of Cosmic Encounters, but apparently it's much rarer than I expected
    so if anyone has any information regarding how I can find it locally... hit that contact button. 
</p>
